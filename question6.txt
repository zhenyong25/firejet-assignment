// Question 6: `fs is undefined`

When using build tools like vite or tailwind, sometimes we encounter the error `fs is undefined`

1. Name some cases where fs is defined and some cases where it is undefined
fs (File System) is a module available in Node.js, and its availability varies based on the environment:

a. Node.js Environment: In a Node.js environment, the fs module is defined and available for reading and writing files.
You can use it to perform various file operations, such as reading, writing, and manipulating files.

b. Browser Environment: In a browser environment, the fs module is not available by default. When you encounter the "fs is undefined" error, 
it typically means that your code is attempting to use Node.js-specific modules or APIs in a browser environment. 
Browsers do not have direct access to the file system for security reasons.

2. In the case that fs is undefined, suggest how we can make fs defined, so that we can continue using build tools like vite and tailwind.
To make fs defined in a browser-based project, you need to simulate or replicate the functionality you require without directly using Node.js's fs module. Some options include:

a. Use a Mock or Fake fs: There are libraries and packages available that provide mock implementations of the fs module for the browser environment. 
These allow you to use similar code for reading and writing files, but it operates in-memory or using browser storage mechanisms. Examples of such libraries include browserify-fs and memfs.

b. Third-Party Libraries: You can also look for third-party libraries that provide file manipulation capabilities specifically designed for browser-based projects. 
Libraries like fs-extra-browser or fs-browser are examples of such alternatives.
