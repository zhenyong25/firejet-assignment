// Question 5: Image not Updating

When converting a design with the [FireJet Figma Plugin](https://www.firejet.io/plugin), sometimes when the image is updated in our database, 
when visiting the website, the image still remains unupdated when viewing on codesandbox

1. Suggest why the image has not been updated






2. Suggest how we could get the image to be updated when viewed in codesandbox
