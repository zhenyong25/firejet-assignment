// Original Code 
export async function arrayToBase64(array: Uint8Array) {
    const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
    const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
  
    const imageData = await decode(canvas, ctx!, array);
  
    return imageData;
  }

// Error 
The error "document is undefined" is occurring because your code is attempting to use the document object, 
which is a part of the Browser Document Object Model (DOM), and it's typically available only in a browser environment, 
not in a Node.js environment. If you're running this code in a Node.js environment, you don't have access to the browser's 
document object, as it's specific to web browsers. You can't create a canvas element and use it in a Node.js environment 
like you can in a browser.

// To fix this issue
1. Ensure that you are running your code in a browser environment, where the document object is defined. 
In a web browser, the document object represents the web page's content and structure.

2. Modify your code to work in a Node.js environment if that is your intention. In a Node.js environment, you can't use the document object. 
You might need to re-implement the functionality without relying on browser-specific features like canvas.

// Fixed Code 
import { createCanvas } from 'canvas';

export async function arrayToBase64(array: Uint8Array) {
  const canvas = createCanvas(/* width */, /* height */);
  const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

  const imageData = await decode(canvas, ctx!, array);

  return imageData;
}
